# EANM
Simple settings manager for EVE. Set up your settings on one character, then use EANM to reflect your changes on all your characters !

# Installation
1. Download jar file (https://github.com/Bertral/EANM/raw/master/out/artifacts/EANM_jar/EANM.jar) or build it from source (this is an IDEA project).
2. Locate your settings directory (which should be in /users/USERNAME/Local Settings/Application Data/CCP/EVE/c_tq_tranquility/ or similar)
3. Place EANM.jar inside the settings directory, where all your "core_char_XXXXXX.dat" are.

# Usage
0. It is highly recommended that you backup your settings before using EANM.
1. Chose wether you want your "main" (the settings that will overwrite all the others) to be the oldest of all the characters ever used on your computer, or the most recently used (as in "logged in") character on your computer.
2. Chose wether you want character specific, account specific, or all settings to be overwitten.
3. Click "Overwrite".
